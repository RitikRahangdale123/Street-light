Relay-It provides isolation between the controller and the device because as we know devices may work on AC as well as on DC but they receive signals from microcontroller which works on DC hence we require a relay to bridge the gap. The relay is extremely useful when you need to control a large amount of current or voltage with the small electrical signal.


Microcontoller-The microcontroller discovers broad recognition in supplying automobile solutions. They are extensively utilized in hybrid motor vehicles to control engine variations. Also, works such as cruise power and anti-brake mechanism have created it more capable with the amalgamation of micro-controllers.

Light sensors- The light sensor is a passive device that converts the light energy into an electrical signal output. Light sensors are more commonly known as Photoelectric Devices or Photo Sensors because they convert light energy (photons) into electronic signal (electrons).

Solar Panel-Solar panels, sometimes also called photovoltaics collect energy from the Sun in the form of sunlight and convert it into electricity that can be used to power homes or businesses.

LED Driving Circuit-An LED circuit or LED driver is an electrical circuit used to power a light-emitting diode (LED). The circuit must provide sufficient current to light the LED at the required brightness, but must limit the current to prevent damaging the LED.


# Requirement

Central System-Microcontroller
Sub-system-LED driver circuit

Low Level Requirement-
1)switch to turn on/off the Street light.
2)power supply needed for the operation of device i.e. for microcontroller, sensor,LED,Actuator,etc.

High Level Requirement-
1)Street light shall be on at proper time and without the help of any person.


Test Case-
when power is supplied to check whether the system is working or not(Y/N)
when power is suppplied to check whether the led is turning on or not(Y/N)
to check whether the microcontroller is receving the signal or not(Y/N).
to check whether the LED sensor is working or not(Y/N).
